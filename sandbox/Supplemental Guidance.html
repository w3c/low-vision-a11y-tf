<td>Scaling for resize of text for large type  elements</td>
<td>Large headings may already be 200% the body size of text. Responsive design reduces amount of content on screen taking away context and surrounding context.  Requiring all text to scale by 200% may not be practical or help.  Text needs to scale in proportion so relationships can still be determined.</td>

This isn&#39;t so much as fail under current requirements as it can be accepted and dismissed but requiring low vision users to accept something that a non-disabled user can choose not to seems un equal.  <br/>This issue also occurs with videos that cover text when zoomed in or when controls cover text when zoomed in but the text can be scrolled.</td>
